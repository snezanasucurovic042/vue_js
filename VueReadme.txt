i have some experience with Java swing and JavaScript, indeed UI programming. About this issue i can say:
1.it is necessary install Vue.js
2. to become comfortable with component organisation
3. to connect with teams who make chart components and then include it in project ( for example https://yugasun.github.io/x-chart/?ref=madewithvuejs.com#/)
I  placed on Github :
1. my-component.vue (child component)
2. index.html (parent component)
3. png fajl with ads for chart components

i hope this is useful and that i've earned 5$.
